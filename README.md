This repository contains all the code and data necessary to run SuilluScope v1.0Beta, available at www.SuilluScope.com
<br><br>
SuilluScope is an interactive, open access database for <i>Suillus</i> fungi, a model genus for ectomycorrhizal ecology and evolution. 
This platform provides data on the phenotypic traits and responses of genome-sequenced isolates, aiming to help researchers identify optimal culture conditions, predict and compare trait responses across species, and empower further research linking genotypes to phenotypes.
<br><br>
All isolates used in the database are from the <i>Suillus</i> Genome Strain Culture Collection and are available to the public. 
Isolates amenable to cryopreservation have been integrated into the Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection (NRRL) (https://nrrl.ncaur.usda.gov/).
Accession numbers for these strains are listed in the SuilluScope metadata tab. Isolates which cannot be cryopreserved are available by contacting the author via the SuilluScope interface.
<br><br>
Genomic resources for these cultures are available on MycoCosm's <i>Suillus</i> web portal (https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Suillus/Suillus.info.html) opperated by DOE Joint Genome Institute
For more information on the <i>Suillus</i> system, please visit The International <i>Suillus</i> Consortium webpage at https://www2.hawaii.edu/~nn33/suillus/.
<br><br>
SuilluScope was built using the open source programming language R (https://www.r-project.org/about.html), with reactive programming via R shiny
(https://shiny.rstudio.com). If you have feature requests or a published dataset that you would like us to consider adding to SuilluScope
please contact us via the website.
