This repository contains all the code and data necessary to run SuilluScope v1.0Beta, available at www.SuilluScope.com
<br><br>
SuilluScope is an interactive, open access database for <i>Suillus</i> fungi, a model genus for ectomycorrhizal ecology and evolution. 
This platform provides data on the phenotypic traits and responses of genome-sequenced isolates, aiming to help researchers identify optimal culture conditions, predict and compare trait responses across species, and empower further research linking genotypes to phenotypes.
<br><br>


All isolates used in the database are from the <i>Suillus</i> Genome Strain Culture Collection and are available to the public. Isolates amenable to cryopreservation have been integrated into the Agricultural Research Culture Collection (NRRL). Accession numbers for these strains are listed in the SuilluScope metadata tab. Isolates which cannot be cryopreserved are available by contacting the author via the SuilluScope interface. If you have feature requests or a published dataset that you would like us to consider adding to this site, please contact us via the website.

SuilluScope was built using the open source programming language R (https://www.r-project.org/about.html), with reactive programming via R shiny
(https://shiny.rstudio.com)


Genomic resources for these cultures are available on the MycoCosm Suillus web portal (https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Suillus/Suillus.info.html) opperated by DOE Joint Genome Institute.
